## 👨🏿‍💻 My process

------

First, I created the page's design, I started this process creating a wireframe.

Then I got some inspirations for color scheme in [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and I got fonts for the logo and page content in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I prototyped the page in Figma, I began with the mobile version. The result is in this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/lxaua9UAmD7Heg3PxSJntA/pet-lovers?node-id=0%3A1).

After, I started working in the code, I focused first in the desktop version and then use media queries to adapt the layout to mobile devices.

### 🔨 Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ReactJS

### 🤓 What I learned

I could practice my design skills and I learn about browser support. During the development, I tested the page in some devices and different browsers.

Some issues I encontered was related to CSS properties that behave different in browsers that are webkit based and not webkit based, e.g: Chrome and Firefox.

This problems also was related to desktop version and mobile version of the browsers, I looked into [Can I use It](https://caniuse.com/) website to check what could break depending on the browser and it's version.
